```

### 6.23 Model Evaluation Metrics

#### For Classification (Confusion Matrix)

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
```

**Confusion Matrix**:

```
                Predicted
                Neg    Pos
Actual  Pos     FN     TP
        Neg     TN     FP
```

**When to Use**:

- **Precision**: When false positives are costly
- **Recall**: When false negatives are costly
- **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and recall
- **Accuracy**: Balanced datasets

**AUC-ROC** (Area Under Curve - Receiver Operator Curve):

- Value: 0 to 1 (1 = perfect)
- Shows true positive vs false positive rates
- Compare models at various thresholds

#### For Regression

**Metrics**:

- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error): Average error magnitude
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Percentage error
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error): Square root of average squared errors
- **R² (R Squared)**: Explained variance (closer to 1 = better)

**Example**:

```
Predicting test scores based on study hours
RMSE = 5 → average prediction is 5 points off
R² = 0.8 → 80% of score variation explained by study hours
```

Answer: 3 out of 10 (30%)
```

**For deterministic problems**:

**Components**:

#### Internet Gateway (IGW)

- Help VPC instances connect to internet
- Public subnets have route to IGW

#### NAT Gateway

- AWS-managed
- Allow private subnet instances to access internet
- Remain private

**Diagram**:

```
VPC (CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16)
├── AZ 1
│   ├── Public Subnet (IGW)
│   └── Private Subnet (NAT)
└── AZ 2
    ├── Public Subnet (IGW)
    └── Private Subnet (NAT)
```

#### VPC Endpoints and PrivateLink

**Purpose**: Access AWS services privately (no public internet)

**Types**:

**VPC Endpoint** (powered by PrivateLink):

- Access AWS services from private subnet
- Example: Application in VPC → Bedrock model

**S3 Gateway Endpoint**:

- Also S3 Interface Endpoint available
- Example: SageMaker notebooks → S3 data

**Diagram**:

```
VPC (Private Subnets)
├── Application → Bedrock VPC Endpoint → Bedrock Model
└── SageMaker Notebook → S3 VPC Endpoint → Amazon S3
```

**Network Configuration**:

- Some directories are read-only:
  - /mnt/user-data/uploads
  - /mnt/transcripts
  - /mnt/skills
- Copy to working directory to modify

### 10.13 AWS Services with Bedrock

**IAM with Bedrock**:

**CloudTrail with Bedrock**:

- Analyze API calls to Bedrock

**Config with Bedrock**:

- Configuration changes within Bedrock

**PrivateLink with Bedrock**:

- Keep API calls within private VPC

#### Bedrock Accessing Encrypted S3

**Requirements**:

```
Amazon Bedrock → IAM Role
                    ↓
          Access to S3 + KMS Key
                    ↓
S3 Bucket (encrypted with SSE-KMS)
```

**IAM Role needs**:

- Amazon S3 access
- KMS Key decrypt permission

### 10.14 SageMaker in VPC

**Deployment**:

```
VPC (Private Subnet)
├── SageMaker Notebooks
├── Training Jobs
├── Hosted Endpoints
├── Security Group
└── VPC Endpoint (Amazon S3)
      ↓
   Amazon S3
```

**Components**:

- Security Group
- S3 VPC Endpoint
- Endpoint Policy
- IAM Role

### 10.15 Bedrock Access from VPC

**Architecture**:

```
VPC (Private Subnet)
└── Application → VPC Endpoint (Bedrock)
                  (PrivateLink)
                        ↓
                  Amazon Bedrock Model
```

### 10.16 Analyzing Bedrock Access with CloudTrail

**Scenario: User Access Tracking**

**User A** (with permissions):
```

            ↓
CloudTrail Event: Bedrock ListCustomModels (User A)
```

**User B** (without permissions):
```
User B → Bedrock ListCustomModels API (DENIED)
            ↓
CloudTrail Event: Bedrock ListCustomModels (User B - Denied)
```
